  <h3 style="color:black;">The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), historically found between the continents of Africa and Asia, Are the Fastest land Animals in the world. 
    reaching speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Cheetahs have 2000-3000 spots which help them camouflage well in their habitat. 
    Cheetahs are carnivores which his favorite catch being the Thomsonâ€™s gazelle which just happens to reach a whopping 60 MPH top 
    speed as well. So, a cheetah can run really fast and loves to catch animals that also run really fast. Male cheetahs like to 
    chill together often times with 2-3 brothers. Females are entirely solitary unless with their cubs. Cheetahs reproduce quite young. 
    Males at the Age of 1 and females at the age of 2. Females can have from 2 to 8 cubs in a single time. As majestic as these 
    animals are there are only about 10,000 of them left in the wild. Cheetahs face problems not only from poachers, but also climate 
    change pushes the gazelle they eat further inland so the cheetah has to travel a lot further to reach his food. Thanks to co-ops 
    such as the WWf, and concentrated governmental efforts where the cheetahs live, conservation efforts are in success. The cheetah 
    is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of endangered species. to learn more about the cheetah,
